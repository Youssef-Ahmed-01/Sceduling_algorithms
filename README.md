# Scheduling Calculator

This project implements a scheduling calculator to compute various metrics for scheduling algorithms, including:

- **Termination Time**
- **Waiting Time**
- **Turnaround Time**
- **Normalized Turnaround Time**

Ensure you have a C++ compiler g++ installed on your system.

1. **clone the repo:**
2. **compile and run**
   ```terminal
    g++ scheduler.cpp -o program.exe
    ./program.exe
